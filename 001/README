Implement an RPN calculator that takes an expression like 19 2.14 + 4.5 2
4.3 / - * which is usually expressed as (19 + 2.14) * (4.5 - 2 / 4.3) and
responds with 85.2974. The program should read expressions from standard
input and print the top of the stack to standard output when a newline is
encountered. The program should retain the state of the operand stack
between expressions.
