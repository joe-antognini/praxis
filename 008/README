Programming Praxis
Exercise 8

Calculate the digits of pi using the Chudnovsky formula.  The function will
compute pi to an arbitrary number of decimal places (though calculations to
very large numbers of digits may run into memory issues) and return the
result as a string.  If run on the command line without arguments, the
program will return the 1000th digit of pi.

See this page for a description of the exercise (note, however, that I don't
use a spigot algorithm):
